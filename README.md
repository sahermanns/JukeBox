JukeBox
 I dont know how to submit the link to my "UML class diagram" for the jukebox. 
 
 Problem Statement:
 We are going to make a simplified model of how to play a jukebox.
 
The user interacts with a screen, that screen interacts with the jukebox, the jukebox accesses a catalog of artists, each artist has a list of songs. The user can choose up to 3 songs (this is a free jukebox) and those songs are placed in a play que. Once the user has finished picking songs (up to 3) the speakers then play the slected songs back to the user.
This simulation has objects; User, Screen, Jukebox, Artist, Song, Song Que, Speakers. Each Objects has attributes and respective behaviors.
