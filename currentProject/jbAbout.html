	<article>
		<p>Personiziled Jukebox & Co. wants to build a website to advertise a service they sell, this service is a personalized jukebox. Anyone who visits the site is able to try the free demo jukebox to encourage them to buy their own and customize it to their own tastes.</p>
		<p>The demo jukebox on the main webpage prompts the user to choose an artist they like from the dropdown menu and then leads them to a list of song titles from the artist they selected. They can then select a specific track title to play. If the user doesn't recognize any of the artists in the list they can select a random song from the whole jukebox library to play instead.</p>
